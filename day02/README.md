# Day 02 — Hello, Cortex! (Streamlit in Snowflake)

## Goal
Run an LLM directly inside Snowflake using Cortex and display the response in a Streamlit 
app.

## What I built
- Streamlit UI to accept a prompt
- Calls Snowflake Cortex to generate an answer
- Displays the model response in the app

## Run mode
- Implemented and tested in **Snowsight (Streamlit in Snowflake)**

## Notes
Core learning is tech-agnostic and can be adapted to other platforms and LLM providers.
